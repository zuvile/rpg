Cassius: My name is Cassius. I was told to...
Player: [He hesitates before continuing. I can see that he's hot happy with what he's about to say.]
Cassius: I was told to watch over you, while you study.
Player: Study?
Cassius: Yes. The card that you've found is very important to our order.
Cassius: You are it's owner now. So you will study until you can use it.
    -> No way. I am leaving.
        $rel_mod(Cassius)=-10
        Cassius: No you're not. Listen. Either you learn to use this card, or you die and someone else becomes its owner.
        end_choices
    -> Study... Study what?
        $rel_mod(Cassius)=10
        Cassius: Our ways. There are many more cards like this. Each has an effect. I'll show you everything.

Player: [It seems like I really don't have a say in the matter.]
Player: [Fear and curiosity mix within me.]
Player: What are these cards?
Cassius: Each card has a special ability. They can heal, do damage... Charm and fool people, turn walls into doors, night into day...
Player: [As he talks a spark glitters in his eyes.]
Cassius: Since the card bound itself to you, it means you do have some innate ability... Which is unusual.
Player: unusual how?
Cassius: Because you're a woman.
Player: what does that have to do with anything?
Cassius: I'll explain later. Right now, take this card.
Cassius: [He gives me something.]
Cassius: This is a basic attack card. Go ahead, use it on me.
Player: What? Won't you get hurt?
Cassius: [he laughs]
Cassius: Don't worry about that. I am one of the best.
