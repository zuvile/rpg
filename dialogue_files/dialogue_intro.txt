    Player: [I stand in an old cemetery. It's raining. The air is filled with the smell of dirt and rotting leaves.]
    $setup($render=cemetery.png, $music=ambient/light_rain_outside.wav)
    Player: [Barely anyone has shown up. No one is speaking as the casket is being lowered into the ground.]
    Player: [I hate funerals. Especially when I hardly knew the person.]
    Player: ...
    Player: [I wonder if I can skip the dinner and go home.]
    Mother: Haven't seen my sister in years. And now...
    Player: [I hardly know what to say]
        -> It will be alright.
            Mother: Thanks, dear.

    Mother: I almost forgot. She left you something.
    Player: huh?
    Mother: [My mother pulls out a single picture and hands it to me.]
    $setup($render=final_card.png, $sound=new_card.wav)
    Player: What is this?
    Player: [It's not a picture. It's a card. The text is worn off as though the card has been touched a thousand times.]
    Player: [As I rub the surface of the card it begins to glow...]
    Player: What the...?!
    $jmp=castle_intro
title: castle_intro
    Player: where am I?
    $setup($render=castle.png, $music=STOP)
    Player: [I find myself in an old castle.]
    Player: [Before I have the chance to gather my wits, a man approaches.]
    Cassius: [He is dressed all in black. His piercing blue eyes widen at the sight of me.]
    Cassius: Who are you?
    Player: What... IS this place?
    Cassius: [As the man opens his mouth to speak, his eyes drift to my hand and he sees the card in my hand.]
    Cassius: It can't be...
    Cassius: [The man pulls out a card from his sleeve. Before  I get the chance to say anything, I feel my hands being tied behind your back, as though my invisible force.]
    Cassius: Come with me.
    $setup($render=black.png)
    Cassius: [The man leads you down a long corridor. Your footsteps echo in the halls of this old castle.]
        -> Let me go!
            Cassius: Keep quiet.

        -> [Say nothing]
            Player: [I am too scared to speak.]

    Player: [I am brought into a room where an old man is sitting behind a desk.]
    Cassius: master. This... woman... Appeared just now, and look what she was holding.
    Master: Show me, Cassius.
    Player: [I note the name of the cold man.]
    Cassius: [Cassius rips the card from your hand and shows it to the old man. His eyes widen.]
    Master: Did you bind the card to yourself, woman?
    Player: I don't know what you're talking about... I touched it and... Appeared here.
    Player: [The men share a look. It's obvious that my words mean something to them that I can't comprehend.]
    Master: Then there's only one thing to do.
    Player: [I shudder. My hands are still bound and I can barely move.]
        -> Please. I just want to go home.
            $rel_mod(Cassius)=10
            Cassius: [Cassius looks at you with a hint of sympathy. If even he is sorry for you... What is going to happen?]
            end_choices
        -> Are you kidding me? What are you two on about? Let me go this instant. I'm calling the police.
            Player: [As you reach inside your pocket, you realise there is no pocket. In fact, you are wearing clothes that you do not recognise.]
            end_choices
    Master: You will become a student here, woman. That is the only thing we can do.
    Cassius: Other than to kill you.
    Player: What...
    $setup($render=black.png)
    Player: [You feel yourself slip into a slumber like state. As you close your eyes, your thoughts drift away to your aunt that you barely knew.]
    Player: [What is the card that she had left you?]
    Player: [And what will happen when you wake up...?]
